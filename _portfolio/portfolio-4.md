Competition Focus: Using GD32F303RCT6 as the main control chip, two vehicles cooperatively completed electromagnetic line following, TOF-based tunnel length measurement, Bluetooth communication for coordinated parking/unparking, and ultrasonic obstacle avoidance.

Key Responsibilities & Achievements:

Processed sensor data by normalizing ADC-collected inductor values and applying moving average filtering to eliminate outliers and ensure signal reliability.

Enhanced vehicle control sensitivity by implementing a weighted difference ratio algorithm for precise line-following.

Achieved stable and responsive motion control by developing and tuning an incremental PID control system.

Implemented robust ultrasonic ranging and obstacle avoidance, utilizing timer interrupts to solve timing issues and prevent program freezing.

Technologies: Embedded C, Microcontroller (GD32), Sensor Fusion (Electromagnetic, TOF, Ultrasonic), PID Control, Bluetooth Communication, Timer Interrupts.
