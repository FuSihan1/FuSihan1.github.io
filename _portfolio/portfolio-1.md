**Duration:** Mar 2023 – Mar 2024  
**Role:** Project Leader  
**Project Level:** National-level Innovation Training Project  

**Project Focus:** Investigated multi-robot cooperative coverage of target areas while incorporating obstacle avoidance for static obstacles.

**Key Responsibilities & Achievements:**
*   Applied a **hexagonal grid discretization method** to partition sub-areas, ensuring low repetition and high coverage.
*   Utilized **K-means clustering** for target point classification and **simulated annealing** for optimal path planning within each cluster.
*   Achieved the shortest path length per route and a final **coverage rate of 98.52%**.
*   Implemented a **geometry-based shortest-path obstacle avoidance** algorithm for known convex polygonal obstacles.

**Technologies:** Algorithm Design (K-means, Simulated Annealing), Robotics, Path Planning.
