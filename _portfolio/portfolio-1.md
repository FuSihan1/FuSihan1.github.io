excerpt: "Construction and Implementation of a Multi-Robot Cooperative Area Coverage System, National-level Innovation Training, Project Project Leader"
excerpt: "✓ Project Focus: Investigated multi-robot cooperative coverage of target areas while incorporating obstacle avoidance for static obstacles.
✓ Responsibilities: Applied a hexagonal grid discretization method to partition sub-areas, ensuring low repetition and high coverage. Used K-means clustering to classify target points, and performed path planning for each cluster via simulated annealing, achieving the shortest path length per route and a coverage rate of 98.52%. For known convex polygonal obstacles, a geometry-based method was adopted to achieve shortest-path obstacle avoidance."
